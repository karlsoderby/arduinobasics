# Arduino Basics

### Photo Resistor with LED
This example is a way to simulate how sunpower works. By shining light on the photo resistor, it will light an LED. This example is useful to teach younger students.

### Potentiometer with a continuous servo motor
This example uses a potentiometer to regulate a servo motor. It starts in a standby mode at 94 degrees, and if the potentiometer generates a set value it will start to rotate. A long with this is also three LED's that will light up according to how much you twist the potentiometer. A good way to teach younger students the very basic of how wind turbins work.
